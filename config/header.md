This curated list contains {project_count} awesome simulator projects with a total of {stars_count} stars grouped into {category_count} categories. All projects are ranked by a project-quality score, which is calculated based on various metrics automatically collected from GitHub and different package managers. If you like to add or update projects, feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/knmcguire/best-of-robot-simulators/issues/new/choose), submit a [pull request](https://github.com/knmcguire/best-of-robot-simulators/pulls), or directly edit the [projects.yaml](https://github.com/knmcguire/best-of-robot-simulators/edit/main/projects.yaml).

### Definition Robotics Simulator
Here is a definition of a robotics simulator derived in [this blogpost](https://www.mcguirerobotics.com/blog/2025/04/17/navigating-through-the-robotic-simulation-landscape/)

> A robotic simulator is a software framework that provides a virtual environment, often leveraging different physics/rendering engines and sensor models, to model the robot's behavior, its interaction and perception with the simulated world for design, evaluative or data-generative purposes.

With:

* **virtual environment** - To provide the scenario for the simulated robot to act in, depending on the application, like an indoor building, forest, or lunar landscape.
* **behavior, its interaction and perception** - The simulated entity should be able to interact with and act upon that virtual environment or world through its simulated sensors and actuators.
* **physics/rendering engines and sensor models** - To be able to simulate those interactions and perceptions caused by the robot's behavior, to model how an object will slip while being grasped or the noise of the lidar ranges.
* **design, evaluative or data-generative** - To use this as a development tool, as part of continuous integration to assure quality, or to collect data that can be used for AI training purposes.
